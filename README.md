# More about project
I have been learning Java since February 2024. As we all know nothing teach more as own projects where we can implement new things and examine our knowledge.
Here I was able to connect to the data base and write some tests for example create user on UI and check if created user appears on DB :satisfied:

I implemented extent report so after each tests run html file will be created:

![report](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c127c670-b59b-4569-afdf-156b9589c69d)

Screenshoots are also included in the report so you can easily check where test failed or went through. What you need to do is click on purple label with text: **base64 img**
