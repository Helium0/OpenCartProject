# More about project
I have been learning Java since February 2024. As we all know nothing teach more as own projects where we can implement new things and examine our knowledge.
Here I was able to connect to the data base and write some tests for example create user on UI and check if created user appears on DB :satisfied:

You can run tests class by class or click RMC and run all tests from xml file:

I implemented extent report so after each tests run html file will be created:

Graphical report sample:

Screenshoots are also included in the report so you can easily check where test failed or went through. What you need to do is click on purple label with text: **base64 img**

I used two approaches from where I pass data to my tests. 
- from text file, here I had to use Properties class
- from json file, here I had to use Data provider adnotation
